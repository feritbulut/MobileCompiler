# üì± Mobile Compiler App (Built with .NET MAUI)  

## Overview  
This is a **mobile compiler application** that allows you to write, compile, and execute code in **C#, C++, Python, and Java** on your mobile device. The app is built using **.NET MAUI** and integrates with **JDoodle API** for remote code execution.  

## Features  
‚úÖ **Multi-language support:** Run C#, C++, Python, and Java code.  
‚úÖ **User-friendly UI:** Easy-to-use interface for writing and executing code.  
‚úÖ **Live Compilation:** Real-time output from the compiler.  
‚úÖ **Useful Resources:** Built-in documentation for each language.
